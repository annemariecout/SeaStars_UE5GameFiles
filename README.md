Description: This repository contains the Unreal Engine 5 files of the first game I ever made.
Sea Stars is a third person game where the player has to reach a floating treasure chest through a series of elevating platforms and teleporters while avoiding evil flying starfish, deadly water and mighty bubbles.
It was developed during my first term as a student in the Game Development Program at Vertex School.
Made in Unreal Engine (blueprints), using Megascans and a Paragon character.

This project is a collection of tests and experiments made as I was learning how to create landscapes, animated or technical materials, blueprints, anything you need to know to make a first game. It takes the character through common game actions like fighting enemies and bosses, jumping on elevating platforms, chosing the right teleporter, all that to ultimately reach the burning treasure chest that fell from the sky.
